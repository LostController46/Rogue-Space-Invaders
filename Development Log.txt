Resizing the game forced the player into the middle, will correct soon.
Added Menus before going further because it caused a lot of code to be moved around.
Started work on the enemies.
Need to fix player controls to add a charged shot.

Had a bug on how the movement of the shooter enemy. Should be fixed now.
Learned that classes initilize the number given forever, has to be inside
the class in order to get random numbers.
Should have a button that lets the player slow down to get more percise movement.
Also need to work on the shoot not working when the player is moving.
