Resizing the game forced the player into the middle, will correct soon.
Added Menus before going further because it caused a lot of code to be moved around.
Started work on the enemies.
Need to fix player controls to add a charged shot.

9/7/25
Had a bug on how the movement of the shooter enemy. Should be fixed now.
Learned that classes initilize the number given forever, has to be inside
the class in order to get random numbers.
Should have a button that lets the player slow down to get more percise movement.
Also need to work on the shoot not working when the player is moving.

9/12/25
Worked on the shooting mechanic for the Player. Fix was to make it so movement
and the shoot are not in the same if-else branch. Added slow movement for
more precision movement. Add a new class for bullets to make adding new
bullets and to make the charged shot implementation easier. Add a progress
bar for the charged shot so to see how close it is to done.

9/13/25
Added new enemy called the Charger. Rushes towards the player to attack them.
Another enemy type was created called the Blocker. Will not take damage from normal
shots, they must be charged. Rebound the Focus and Charging Keys. Started work on
Combustion enemy type, had an issue with the bullets only moving down. Unknown fix at
this time.

9/14/25
Figured out that the Bullet class needed a direction added to make it so the bullets
have a direction they move in. This lead to fixing Shooter, how enemyBullets despawns
bullets, and the player's bulletsafter implementing directions to the Bullet class.
The first Boss will be worked on next time.

9/15/25
Began work on making a Player class to implement changes to add Health to the player,
and damage. Player can now take damages, has immunity frames, and despawns when killed.

9/20/25
Changed Controls to a How To Play Button. Added info on controls and what enemy does what.
Added a Pause Button, that let's you quit to main menu. Charge Shot kept charging while
paused. Unknown fix at this time. Work started on First Boss. Is a Fusion of Shooter & 
Blocker enemy types. Need to work on Lasers from boss and have it actually patrol correctly.

9/21/25
The first Boss has been fixed along with the Lasers. Fixing logic for the Laser was incredibly
hard to make it follow who shot the bullet. Boss also takes no damage if hit on the main body,
but does take damage from getting hit on the guns.

9/25/25
Adding pause as a parameter for everything fixed the main issue with many things moving and
updating when it shouldn't be possible.

9/26/25

the player dies and a game over screen. The game also now fully resets when a new game is started.

10/2/25
Separated most logic for game into multiple files. Main.py is now easier to read. Pause button
now freezes time correctly for the Charged Shot, enemy spawning, and laser despawn time. Was fixed
by subtracting the time the game was paused from the game's current time.

10/3/25
Added functionality to the map. Can now traverse throughout the map and now displays actual useful
information about the level. Map was also resized to fit all information. Level dictates what
enemies can spawn and how many should spawn.

10/5/25
Made it so enemies now added their worth to the players's cash on death. Tweaked text size of HUD.
Also added sprites for the Player, Basic, Shooter, and Charger. Known bug is that the other enemies 
are currently using the Basic enemy sprite. Will be fixed once the rest of the sprites are complete.

10/11/25
Started work on adding parts to the game. Common parts have been added to the game. Added a basic
functionality to obtain parts and healing. HUD displays collected parts. Some checks need to be
added to certain locations.

10/12/25
Added more parameters for the player to interact with the parts mechanic better. Created and added
funcitonality for the shop.

10/17/25
Added a group spawning mechanic for enemies. Needs to be tweaked to spawn either slower or a set 
amount of enemies on screen. Added Shop now works in main loop. Need to remove items from shop 
once bought. Fixed small issues with parameter changes. The Boss's laser is broken again and 
needs to be fixed (continously shooting). Otherwise, core gameplay is now finished. 

10/18/25
Added basic functionality of shop for Ship upgrades. Still needs implementation of upgrading stats.
Will add to the updateStats funciton for player.py. Placeholder code is in place for the Sabotages
of the shop.

10/23/25
Fixed Boss infinitely firing by giving it it's own timer instead of relying on the game's timer.
Added missing call to shop to update stats.

Parts are now removed from the shop when bought. Reworked Blocker to have a damage reduction
mechanic instead of blocking all bullet shots.

11/1/25
Bullets, Lasers, and Enemy Death sounds have been added.

11/3/25
Lasers have been given to the player.

11/5/25
Fixed laser by giving it an afterimage that does no damage. Finished work on Miss-iles, two bullets
